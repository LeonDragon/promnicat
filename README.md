Model Collection of the Business Process Management Academic Initiative
 Weske, Mathias; Decker, Gero;  Dumas, Marlon;  La Rosa, Marcello;  Mendling, Jan;  Reijers, Hajo A.

This model collection contains 29,810 models. The collection originates from the BPM Academic Initiative (BPMAI). In 2012, the initial members of this initiative were the following institutions represented by the corresponding professors: Mathias Weske (HPI,  University of Potsdam), Jan Mendling (WU Vienna), Michael Rosemann (Queensland University of Technology, Australia), Jan Recker (Queensland University of Technology, Australia), Wil van der Aalst (Technical University Eindhoven, The Netherlands), Michael zur MÃ¼hlen (Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ) and Frank Leymann (University of Stuttgart), respectively, complemented by Dr. Gero Decker (Signavio GmbH, Berlin). The vendor Signavio provides a free workspace to the members of the BPM Academic Initiative and the models being created are made available for reseach purposes on the Creative Commons licence.

The BPM Academic Initiative collection comprises tens of thousands of models, of various process modeling languages, and size. Models of the collection are available in several revisions, which opens a new perspective in researching the way people model.
The BPMAI collection is shared in a JSON format. Tools have been developed at HPI, University of Potsdam for efficiently processing these files. See the PromniCat project. Note that this project is no longer further developed, so you have to work with the information available there. Various analysis techniques can be applied for these models using the jBPT library or Apromore.
